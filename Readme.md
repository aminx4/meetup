# Welcome on Meetup-like project of Software Craftsmanship Lyon community

The goal of this project is to go beyond katas, with a "real" project on which we want to experiment Software Craftsmanship practices concretely, not just discuss about it !

Practicing we expect to have lots of things to exchange together.

## Why Meetup-like ?

We though it would be enough "complex" project to work on to avoid "simplicity" bias of katas. We also hope to (perhaps) build a free and open alternative to Meetup...let's see...

## Tools

There is a Trello board associated with this repository : https://trello.com/b/zuo7PmoE/swcraftmeetup (in French for now...)

You can also join us on Lyon Tech Hub slack, channel #swcraft_meetup (https://slack.lyontechhub.org/)

## Next step

Begin implementing first User Stories. We split User Stories in 3 sub-domains/contexts : 
- Activities : what people have to propose for an event, can be a talk, a workshop, a run, a game...
- Events : organize an event that will propose activities and that people can join to share this activity... 
- Subscriptions : how participants say that they will join an event...

It was shared that we can use different technologies for each context, since we want to decouple them (and by the way, it allows to use several technologies...then everyone should be able to find what they search in this project).  

## Steps already done

December 2015 - Event Storming : to discover the "domain" (in the sense of DDD-Domain Driven Design)

February 2016 - User Stories : list and prioritize first User Stories to implement, with a MVP (Minimu Viable Product) spirit in mind...we also 

## Hot topics :)

We welcome every one in this project, with lots of different profiles.

Some discussions around this project led to share several opinionated visions (some would say "trolls"). Here is excerpt of these (to detail to give pros and cons of each visions) :
- Frameworks vs libs : some heavily rely on frameworks at first, others prefer small libs and avoid coupling with frameworks 
- Which platform/technology should we use : some prefer using their preferred environment, some wants to discover new things (functional approach, languages...) 
- Licences : free and open project lead to discuss about licences, the subject is not really well known, some people knows more about it...we started with a MIT licence.
- "Micro-services" : beware of the keyword...(we talked about "small" services, to avoid naming it ;))
